You know how some koozies get all sweaty and wet? A good stainless steel one wouldn't do that.  Another thing would be to have different sizes or maybe a design that can adjust to fit different cans and bottles like those skinny seltzers or wider beer bottles. No one wants to buy a separate koozie for every type of drink.  A built in bottle opener would be a game changer. You're always looking for one of those when you need it and it's a pain when you don't have one handy.  Think about the grip. A textured finish or a rubberized bottom would make it easier to hold and keep it from sliding around and tipping over.  Finally making it super durable and easy to clean would be a big plus.

One improvement on the To-Go Buddy (the kind without a handle) would be a handle like the one on the FreeSip Sway, large enough so your knuckles don't touch the end of the straw from your McDonald's cup. The To-Go Buddy can be a little top-heavy especially if you have a medium or small drink that sits in the top of it instead of filling most of it like a large drink would. Not sure how to fix that, though, since you'd still want it to be narrow enough at the bottom to fit in a cupholder. They do have a Thicc Buddy that has a side handle, and I haven't tried that yet, but my wife uses a 32-oz Ozark Trail tumbler to hold her large McDonald's Diet Coke, so I think Frost Buddy's version would be similar, though they have several bells & whistles. The Universal XL holds many different kind of cans/bottles but not as many as exist, so sometimes there is space between the neck of a bottle (like Ale-8-One) and the rubber lid's inner edge and it can shift when you tilt it if you're not careful. Overall, though, I've been very happy to have the Universal XL when I drink from soda bottles or cans, especially at work and I'm at my desk intermittently throughout the day. The To-Go Buddy does a great job keeping any size restaurant drink cup cold, usually with ice still in it the next morning. Before I found either of those Frost Buddy products, I looked for years but had only found one koozie that worked for 20-oz soft drink bottles, and that was neoprene so it didn't keep them cold very long. Other neoprene bottle koozies are usually made for beer bottles, but I don't drink beer.

The To-Go Buddy can be a little top-heavy especially if you have a medium or small drink that sits in the top of it instead of filling most of it like a large drink would.

The Universal XL holds many different kind of cans/bottles but not as many as exist, so sometimes there is space between the neck of a bottle (like Ale-8-One) and the rubber lid's inner edge and it can shift when you tilt it if you're not careful.

I recently saw a product on Instagram that was a reusable clip-on lid with a straw for soda cans. It would be amazing if Owala combined that with a Koozie, possibly making the straw optional.  If this fits at least a standard can, actually keeps it cold, fits in a cup holder, and looks nice, I would buy it right away.

One improvement on the To-Go Buddy (the kind without a handle) would be a handle like the one on the FreeSip Sway, large enough so your knuckles don't touch the end of the straw from your McDonald's cup. The To-Go Buddy can be a little top-heavy especially if you have a medium or small drink that sits in the top of it instead of filling most of it like a large drink would. Not sure how to fix that, though, since you'd still want it to be narrow enough at the bottom to fit in a cupholder. They do have a Thicc Buddy that has a side handle, and I haven't tried that yet, but my wife uses a 32-oz Ozark Trail tumbler to hold her large McDonald's Diet Coke, so I think Frost Buddy's version would be similar, though they have several bells & whistles. The Universal XL holds many different kind of cans/bottles but not as many as exist, so sometimes there is space between the neck of a bottle (like Ale-8-One) and the rubber lid's inner edge and it can shift when you tilt it if you're not careful. Overall, though, I've been very happy to have the Universal XL when I drink from soda bottles or cans, especially at work and I'm at my desk intermittently throughout the day. The To-Go Buddy does a great job keeping any size restaurant drink cup cold, usually with ice still in it the next morning. Before I found either of those Frost Buddy products, I looked for years but had only found one koozie that worked for 20-oz soft drink bottles, and that was neoprene so it didn't keep them cold very long. Other neoprene bottle koozies are usually made for beer bottles, but I don't drink beer.
